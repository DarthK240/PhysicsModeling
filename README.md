# Physics Modeling
This is a notebook detailing a problem from my college-level physics class. 
In summary, the problem involved finding an optimized value of the constant A used in the formula y = A*x^(3/2), used to find the relationship between the semi-major axis and orbital period (both in Astronomical Units) of all planets in the Solar System. 
It involved using multiple Python data science and visualization libraries, including scipy and matplotlib.
